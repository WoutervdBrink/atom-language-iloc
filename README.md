# ILOC Language Package
This package introduces minimal support for the ILOC language to Atom, as it is used in the Programming Paradigms course at University of Twente.

## Features
- Recognizes most tokens and marks them accordingly;
- Allows you to easily (de)comment entire sections of code;

## Missing features
- Does not care _at all_ about program structure; accepts anything.
